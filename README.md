| `jj` | Display a list of unresolved issues sorted by their last updated date. The list is filtered by Alfred. |
| `ju` | Force update the local data |

When using the `jj` command, some smart filtering can be done:

```bash
# Filter by project
jj p=<PROJECT_KEY>

# Filter by assignee
jj u=<USERNAME>

# Filter by status
jj s=<STATUS>

# Filter by sprint status
jj sp=<SPRINT_STATUS>
```
